#Space Ghost Sheep#
This project is a Unity-based C# physical game where three little robots,
so-called Cellulo robots, are used. Two represent dogs and are player-
controlled, whereas the third is meant to be a sheep. Both players compete
against each other in the aim to push the sheep into a green hole in the
middle of the field and whoever is closest to it, gets points. But beware:
At any point the sheep may turn into a ghost and start hunting you!

A WebGL version of the game is available here: https://hkhodr.github.io/spacesheep/

This project is part of a course in EPFL, all right to their respective owner
